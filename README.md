This is a project called Woof App. In the app you can search dog breeds and information with picture about selected or found breed. In this project I used React Query and axios to download the list of breed, information and a lot of picture each of the breed. For routing i used library React Router 6, and typescript for types in this app. The app is responsive and work properly both on desktop and mobile. The default language is English so you can search breed only in English language. Below are screenshots of how it looks.
